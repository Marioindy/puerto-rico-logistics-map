# Important Warehouse Map Fields for Selection

When designing a warehouse map system to help users select appropriate warehouses, there are numerous critical data fields that should be displayed. Based on your mention of "paletas" (Spanish for pallets), I'll provide comprehensive recommendations for warehouse mapping fields that would be essential for warehouse selection.

## Core Physical Specifications

**Storage Capacity and Dimensions**

- Total square footage and cubic volume[^1][^2]
- Number of pallet positions (both floor and rack storage)[^2][^3]
- Clear height measurements from floor to lowest obstruction[^4]
- Maximum stack height capabilities[^4]
- Storage density ratios (pallets per square meter)[^5]
- Building dimensions (length, width, height)[^4]

**Pallet-Specific Information**

- Maximum pallet capacity (total number of paletas that can fit)[^3][^2]
- Pallet size compatibility (standard 48"x40", Euro pallets, custom sizes)[^6][^7]
- Weight capacity per pallet position[^8][^3]
- Stacking capabilities (number of pallets high)[^2][^4]
- Pallet flow and accessibility ratings[^9]


## Temperature and Environmental Controls

**Storage Type Classifications**

- Room temperature storage areas[^10][^11]

- Insulation quality ratings[^12][^10]
- Energy efficiency certifications[^10]
- Temperature mapping validation status[^16]


## Warehouse Classification and Infrastructure

**Facility Class Ratings**

- Warehouse class designation (Class A, B, C, or D)[^17]

## Location and Accessibility

**Strategic Positioning**

- Distance to major transportation hubs[^11][^5]
- Proximity to highways, ports, airports[^11][^14]
- Urban vs. suburban vs. rural location[^17]
- Access to labor markets[^5]

**Site Characteristics**

- Truck maneuvering space availability[^2][^14][^5]
- Parking capacity for trucks and employee vehicles[^14][^5]
- Site drainage and weather protection[^14][^5]
- Security perimeter and access controls[^19][^14]


## Specialized Features and Services

**Value-Added Services**

- Cross-docking capabilities[^29][^15]
- Order picking and packing services[^25][^19]
- Quality control and inspection areas[^24][^19]
- Repackaging and labeling services[^19][^14]
- Returns processing capabilities[^24][^25]

**Compliance and Certifications**

- Food safety certifications (HACCP, BRC, etc.)[^30][^12]
- Pharmaceutical storage compliance[^15][^14]
- Customs bonded warehouse status[^15]
- Environmental compliance certifications[^17][^14]
- Security certifications and protocols[^31][^19]


## Additional Considerations

**Operational Metrics**

- Current utilization rates[^32][^21]
- Average throughput capacity[^22][^24]
- Order processing speed capabilities[^9][^22]
- Accuracy rates for picking and shipping[^22][^24]

**Facility Amenities**

- Office space availability[^5][^19][^14]
- Employee facilities (break rooms, restrooms)[^19][^14]
- Maintenance areas and equipment storage[^33][^14]
- Meeting and conference room access[^14][^19]


## Beyond the Basics: Advanced Features

**Smart Warehouse Capabilities**
